I recently completed my M.A. in [Climate and Society](http://climatesociety.ei.columbia.edu/) from Columbia University. While there, I focused on regional and global climate dynamics and the carbon cycle. 

I'm currently working as a climate researcher and video journalist. The majority of my time is spent at the International Research Institute for Climate & Society (IRI) at Columbia University. I support research on floods for the [NASA GEO flash flood project](https://geo.floods.global), as well as supporting [SatWIN-ALERT](https://satwin.iri.columbia.edu/). 

My most recent video work can be found on [Hot Mess](https://youtube.com/HotMessPBS) - a YouTube show from PBS Digital Studios about how climate change impacts all of us, and about how we can create a better future for our planet and ourselves. I primarily write and host videos about how climate change is affecting us, and how are we adapting. 

So far, my favorite video is the one below. It is all about one of the more optimistic stories from the environmental movement, the Montreal Protocol, and how that landmark international policy could inform how the global community deals with climate change.
